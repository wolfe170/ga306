This script opens a window that allows the user to both check for errors and add suffixes
that are important to when exporting low and high poly models to substance painter.

Substance Painter's baking software requires low poly objects to have the suffix _low
and high to have _high. additionally, each item in low poly needs to have its equivalent
in the high poly to be named identically (save for the suffixes). The error section of
my script checks to make sure there are properly named items, and lets you know if you
need to rename something in the low poly, or possibly combine something in the high poly.

The difficult part about this script is being able to rename items in nested groups.
I needed to find, and pass down a nested group name to each item because maya sees nested
items with the same name as the same object unless you pass the group name along.

The maya scene is the test scene i was working on, with the low and high poly group with
nested items. That way you dont need to set anything up on your own if you want to test it.
